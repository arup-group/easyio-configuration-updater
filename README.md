# EASYIO CONFIGURATION UPDATER

This project provides tools intended to be used in conjunction with the JCI EasyIO project backup and restore utilities for  EasyIO BMS controller products.

Specifically, the tools facilitate:

1. Identifying the most recent backup associated with a particular device in the backup and download workflow.

2. Expanding the compressed .tar archive and updating the keys for MQTT communications.

3. Updating the MQTT configuration.

4. Archiving the updated files and organising them for an upload and restore workflow.

## System requirements

To benefit from the tools in this project, you need to have the EMS package from JCI, which manages backup and restoration of configuration files from EasyIO devices. These tools are supported to run on a Windows computer. You'll also need one or more EasyIO controller devices to test the workflow from end-to-end.

The project runs in a command line or terminal environment. Windows computers need to have MSYS2, Git for Windows, or WSL installed to use the bash shell script version. Alternatively, the transliterated Powershell version can run in a Powershell window.

## Example
